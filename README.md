Each question has it's own file
But each subsequent question has the contents of the last question(s)
For example file of "Question 3" includes code for Question 2 and Question 1 as well.

However after start of Question 4, all previous questions are discarded, and question 4 starts the whole process from start. The code for all questions after question 4 will be linked with question 4.
