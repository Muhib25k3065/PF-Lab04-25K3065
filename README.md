## PF Lab 04 Tasks Repository 

Each question has it's own file
But each subsequent question has the contents of the last question(s)
For example file of "Question 3" includes code for Question 2 and Question 1 as well.

However after start of Question 4, all previous questions are discarded, and question 4 starts the whole process from start. The code for all questions after question 4 will be linked with question 4.

## Important point especially for miss Izzah

Question 1 till 3 is a seperate program. From Question 4 onwards I have entered the code seperate from first 3 questions and in question 4 all previous tasks in q1-q3 are redone. This is why in Question 10 file, question 1 till question 3 is commented so that when the program is run, it starts from Question 4 and looks professional in the output CMD.

Also I have uploaded 2 screenshots, one of them is the old one, just ignore it. The newer screenshot is correct and shows final output of question 10 ( ignoring q1-q3 as that is already done again in q4).

Jazakallah.
